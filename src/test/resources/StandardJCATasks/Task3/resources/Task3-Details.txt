Task 3
Task 3 requires you to implement the storage of a password in a database. This database is sqllite-based 
and holds user data consisting of a user name and a password. The project’s main class implements one constructor 
and three methods. The constructor establishes the connection to the database. Method addUser() adds the passed user 
to the database with the password also passed to the method. However, currently, the method lacks any processing of 
the password and stores it as plaintext into the database. The second method retrievePasswordAsStoredInDB() requests 
the password of a given user from the database. Lastly, method verifyPassword() implements a verification of a given 
user/password pair. As passwords are stored in plaintext, it currently only performs a simple equals check for the 
retrieved password vs. passed password suffices.

Implement both the processing of the password to store it in the database as well as the correct verification.

You can check your implementation at any time, by running the three test cases in TaskThreeTest. Currently, one of 
them fails. Only when all of them are passing, your implementation counts as functionally correct.
