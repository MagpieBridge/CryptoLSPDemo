Task 1

This project is supposed to implement a file encryption. In the main class, there is a method encryptfile 
that receives three parameters. 
First, the path to the plain-text file, second, the path to where the ciphertext 
should be stored, and third the password for decryption. Currently, the program simply copies the file, that is, 
it first reads it and then writes it to the output location. This feature is implemented by means of the FileHandler 
class. It currently comprises two methods, readFile() that reads a file and returns its content, and writeContent() 
that writes that content to harddisk again. Your task is to implement the encryption of this file. You can assume 
that you must share the password over the phone.

You can check your implementation at any time, by running the four test cases in TaskOneTest. Currently, one of them 
fails. Only when all four of them are passing, your implementation counts as functionally correct.
